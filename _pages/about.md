Peony Pride Alaska, LLC is located in Alaskaâ€™s Matanuska Valley.  Peony Pride Alaska is a small farm with about 600 plants.  After the youngest of my two sons went off to college, I needed something for my Mom-self to take care of, so I planted our first peony roots in the fall of 2015.  We have Sarah Bernhardt, Avalanche, Henry Sass, Sorbet, Kansas, Coral Charm and Moonstone. 

Peony Pride Alaska, LLC also offers handmade, one of a kind, cloth baskets and rugs created from re-purposed bed sheets.  In 2017, a dear high school friend introduced me to rug making.  In an attempt to make a cat house/bed, I learned how to make baskets!  The original basket is in use as my gardening basket and accompanies me out to the peonies whenever I work in the garden.  

**CURRENTLY AVAILABLE**

I have bundles of 3 stems for \\$10; 15 stems for \\$45.  Bundles are pink with an occasional red or white.  If you are interested, email: peonyprideak@gmail.com

Thanks for visiting!
